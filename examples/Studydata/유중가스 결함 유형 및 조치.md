표 유중가스 결함 유형 및 조치, FMEA
| Fault Types | Key Gases     | Examples of Faults | Recommended Actions |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| D2          | C2H2           | Degradation/Breakdown of winding turn-to-turn insulation; Winding lead discharge; Bushing corona shield discharge; Loose bolts discharge of OLTC tap selector contacts | Internal inspection; Disposal if not identified during inspection |
| T2+D2       | C2H4 + C2H2    | Degradation/Breakdown of winding turn-to-turn insulation; Bushing corona shield discharge; Loose bolts discharge of OLTC tap selector contacts/terminals | Internal inspection; Disposal if not identified during inspection |
| T2+D1       | C2H4 + H2      | Degradation of winding turn-to-turn insulation; Overheating of loose bolts of OLTC tap selector contacts; Core multiple grounds; Core overheating | Internal inspection; On-line monitoring or disposal if not identified |
| T2          | C2H4           | Bushing corona shield overheating; Loose bolts overheating of bushing terminals; OLTC diverter switch cylinder crack; Loose bolts overheating of OLTC tap selector contacts; Core multiple grounds; Core overheating | Internal inspection; On-line monitoring or disposal if not identified |
